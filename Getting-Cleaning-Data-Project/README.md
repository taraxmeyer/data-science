# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT 

#### This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The run_analysis.R script performs:

* Merge the training and test data sets into one data set. 
* Extracts only the measurement mean and standard deviation for each measure.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
* Appropriately labels data with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and for each subject. 


#### Here is the data for the project:
