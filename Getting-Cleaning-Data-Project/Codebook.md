The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 
10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities), 
66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group.  

The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns - 33 Mean variables + 33 Standard deviation variables + 1 Subject ( 1 of the 30 test subjects) + ActivityName + ActivityNum

The tidy data setâ€™s first row is the header containing the names for each column.
